          <p>
            For 20 years, South Combe Waters has provided first class self catering accommodation and fishing 
            in the most stunning and picturesque area of outstanding natural beauty in Devon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our four stunning lakeside Norwegian lodges benefit from the panoramic and breathtaking views of Exmoor, 
            Dartmoor and the Blackdown Hills providing the perfect retreat to forget about the world and do nothing 
            but relax.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our two small and intimate lakes provide fishing for beginners to the more experienced and the best thing is, 
            the walk to the lakes is less than 1 minute from the lodges!
          </p>
          <p>
            With good access to the M5/A30, our holiday Lodges also make the perfect base for visits to Exmoor,
            the North Coast, Dartmoor in the west and also Exeter or browse the wonderful antique shops in Honiton.
          </p>
          <p>             
            The glorious sandy beaches of Exmouth, Sidmouth and Dawlish plus the famous fossil beaches of Lyme Regis, 
            Charmouth and Seaton are only 30 minutes from South Combe Waters. We are also perfectly located to explore 
            the Jurassic Coast and the stunning resorts of Branscombe and Beer.

          <p>
            We hope that the fishing at South Combe Waters enables people of all abilities to catch and enjoy that magical 
            feeling of success on the bank! Whilst the fishing at times can be slow on the Specimen Lake large catches are 
            possible with the right approach.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Mystery Lake is a very pretty lake to fish. Two islands to fish to and one bank which runs alongside 
            a natural wooded area. 'Mystery Lake' contains Mirror, Common, Grass and Koi Carp upto 12lbs, Perch, Roach, 
            Rudd, Bream, Orfe, Tench and Chub. A wonderful little lake that is full of surprises! A perfect stalking lake 
            and a place for children to catch their first ever fish.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Specimen Lake is very well stocked with carp of 20lbs+ with some great features to fish to. 
            Varying depths to 6ft with one small island. The carp are on a progressive feeding programme and are gaining weight
            so be prepared for a tussle. dequate tackle is needed although fishing with high test curve rods is really not needed. 
            Baits that have been working very well are boilies over beds of pellet, pepparami/luncheon meat and of course when 
            the sun is out, never forget surface fishing.
